    <section id="about">
 
  <p>
    I'm <strong>Shahzaib Khan</strong>, a dedicated Software Engineering student currently in my 6th semester, passionate about front-end development and UI/UX design. With hands-on experience in technologies like <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</strong>, and design tools like <strong>Figma</strong>, I love crafting clean, responsive, and user-friendly web interfaces that provide meaningful digital experiences.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’ve worked on diverse academic and personal projects including a <strong>library management system using PHP</strong>, and a <strong>restaurant system built in C</strong>. These projects have strengthened my ability to understand problems, write efficient code, and work across multiple technologies.
  </p>
  <p>
    Beyond development, I’m skilled in tools like <strong>Visual Studio Code, XAMPP</strong>, and <strong>Microsoft Office</strong>. I believe in constant learning and am always exploring new tools and frameworks to grow as a developer.
  </p>
  <p>
    My academic journey started at <strong>Nasra Secondary School, Saddar Karachi</strong> (Matric), followed by <strong>S.M. Govt. Science College Karachi</strong> (Intermediate), and I’m now pursuing a degree in Software Engineering with great enthusiasm.
